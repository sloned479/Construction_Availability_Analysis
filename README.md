# Construction_Availability_Analysis

**Intro:**
This analysis is focused on the hypothetical business problem of where a construction management, maybe a General Contracting company, should spend their time and resources bidding for work. In particular this analyis will focus on three cities: San Francisco, Chicago, and Seattle. The building permitting information should give a sense of the overall landscape of work availability since pretty much all major construction needs to get permits for the work. The other piece of the puzzle is how much competition there is in that city and what the job market looks like. This will come from job postings targeting construction.

**Data:**
For this project the data has been pulled through Kaggle and is originally from the OpenData portals for each of the respective cities. The other data around jobs will come from Indeed through information scraped from their website based on the location and construction interest of this project. There might be some issues with the scraped data, however I am hoping to use the same search terms for each city to make them comparable.
