# Construction_Availability_Analysis

**Intro:**
This analysis is focused on the hypothetical business problem of where a construction management, maybe a General Contracting company, should spend their time and resources bidding for work. In particular this analyis will focus on three cities: San Francisco, Chicago, and Seattle. The building permitting information should give a sense of the overall landscape of work availability since pretty much all major construction needs to get permits for the work. The other piece of the puzzle is how much competition there is in that city and what the job market looks like. This will come from job postings targeting construction.
